# Staking-contract-with-rewards.
An example of a simple DeFi staking contract with rewards.
Key Features:

Allows depositing ERC20 tokens

Provides fixed staking rewards

Enables withdrawal of staked funds and rewards

Technical Implementation:

Uses OpenZeppelin's ERC20 interface

Real-time reward calculations

Basic reward update system

Balance adequacy checks

Core Functions:

stake(): Deposit tokens

withdraw(): Withdraw staked tokens

claimReward(): Claim accumulated rewards

getPendingReward(): View pending rewards

Important Notes:

Users must approve token transfers before staking

For production use, additional implementations are needed:

Security modifiers (e.g., reentrancy protection)

Emergency stop/pause functionality

Event logging

Comprehensive audits

Reward pool replenishment system

Disclaimer:
This is a simplified example demonstrating basic staking logic. Not audited or production-ready. Always implement additional security measures and thorough testing before deployment.
